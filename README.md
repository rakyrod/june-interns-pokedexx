# 🔴 Pokedex App — Build It Yourself

A hands-on tutorial for building a **Pokedex web application** with Node.js and Express.js using a clean **layered architecture**. You learn by building: the application source code is **not included** — you create it yourself, step by step, by following the guide.

## 📚 Start Here — The Guide

> ### 👉 **[Open the Guide → Part 00: Introduction](guide/00-introduction.md)**
>
> This is the heart of the project. The guide walks you through building the **entire** app from an empty folder to a finished, tested application — in order, with nothing skipped.

> ℹ️ **No `src/` folder?** That's intentional. You'll create every file in `src/` as you work through Parts 01–11. By the end you'll have a complete, running Pokedex.

## ✨ What You'll Build

- 📋 Paginated list of Pokemon
- 🔍 Search Pokemon by name or ID
- 🏷️ Filter Pokemon by type
- 📄 Detailed Pokemon pages with full stats
- 🌐 RESTful JSON API endpoints
- 🎨 Server-side rendered views (EJS) styled with Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime |
| **Express.js** | Web framework |
| **EJS** | Template engine |
| **Tailwind CSS (CDN)** | Utility-first styling — no build step |
| **Axios** | HTTP client |
| **PokeAPI** | Pokemon data source |
| **Jest + Supertest** | Testing framework |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Set up your workspace

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interns-pokedex.git
   cd interns-pokedex
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Open the guide and start building**

   👉 **[guide/00-introduction.md](guide/00-introduction.md)**

> The app can only run after you've built `src/` by following the guide. Once you reach **Part 09**, `npm run dev` will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📜 Available Scripts

> These become available as you build the app in the guide.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start the production server |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with hot reload |
| `npm test` | Run tests with coverage |
| `npm run lint` | Check code for linting errors |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Fix linting errors automatically |
| `npm run format` | Format code with Prettier |
| `npm run format:check` | Check code formatting |

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

You'll build the app following a **layered architecture** pattern:

```
Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories → External API (PokeAPI)
```

The `src/` structure you create as you follow the guide:

```
src/
├── app.js              # Application entry point (Part 09)
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── controllers/        # HTTP request handlers
├── repositories/       # Data access layer
├── routes/             # URL routing
├── services/           # Business logic
└── views/              # EJS templates (styled with Tailwind CDN)

public/                 # Static assets (styling via Tailwind CDN — no CSS build)
```

## 🧪 Testing

In **[Part 10](guide/10-testing.md)** you'll write and run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests cover:
- API endpoints (`tests/api.test.js`)
- Service layer (`tests/pokemonService.test.js`)
